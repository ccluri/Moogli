* Introduction

  Moogli (a sister project of [[http://moose.ncbs.res.in][MOOSE]]) is a simulator independent openGL based
  visualization tool for neural simulations. Moogli can visualize morphology
  of single/multiple neurons or network of neurons, and can also
  visualize activity in these cells.

  Moogli is like VLC player for neural simulations.


* Installation

** Additional Software
   1) python2.6/2.7
   2) PyQt4

* Supported Formats

   #+ATTR_HTML: width=80%
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
  [[./static/images/supportedFormats.png]]
   #+END_CENTER

** Input Formats

  Currently .xml (MorphML/NeuroML), .csv for visualizaing morphology of cells
  The .p file format is in development

  The format currently employed for data visualization is [[Additional Information][hdf5]]. The file
  structure  includes morphology of the cell(s) being visualized. Currently
  support Morphml (.xml) Neuroml(.xml) and .csv
  
  Moogli now also supports .csv for data visualization. See /samples/timeSeries.csv for example  

  [[TO DO][In future]]: Employ a standard format for data visualization.
  Also plans to include electrophys file formats.

  Currently: Testing neo compatibility and auto placement of cells.

** Save as formats

  Save screenshot (.png) of the current display.

  Save as movie (.avi) for data visualization.
  [Users will be able to 'direct' their movies soon]
  
* Defaults

  Refer to /Moogli/defaults.py file (the file is self explanatory via comments)

  1) Background color of the scene.
  2) To draw the cells using default settings.
  3) To visualize the cells using default settings.
  4) To use default binning properties.
  5) Speed of visualization updation.
  6) FPS/height/width when saving as .avi

* Keyboard & Mouse shortcuts

  Keyboard - User can bring this up by hitting 'H' key

* Use Cases

** Inspect morphology of cell

   File>Open> (/Moogli/samples/mitralCell.xml)

   #+ATTR_HTML: width=80%
   #+BEGIN_CENTER 
   [[./static/images/mitralCell1.png]]
   #+END_CENTER 

   Above prompt is only seen when [[Defaults][DEFAULT DRAW]] is False

   Selecting to draw all compartments (Button labeled 'A') as cylinders and click 'OK'

   alternatively, if not sure

   Click 'Use Defaults'

   Result:

   #+ATTR_HTML: width=80%
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
   [[./static/images/mitralCell2.png]]
   #+END_CENTER

   Try displaying some of the compartments in a cell as cylinders and others as capsules.


** Display multiple copies of same cell

   File>Open> (/Moogli/samples/cablesIncludedExtended.csv)

   Accomplished by giving an offset position in the style selection prompt

   Result:

   #+ATTR_HTML: width=80%
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
   [[./static/images/stylesOffsetPosition.png]]
   #+END_CENTER

** Visualizing Parameters

   File>Open> (/Moogli/samples/mitral.h5)

   The hdf5 file has the data only for 3 compartments. Moogli can handle partial data. Here showing
   default visualization.

   Result:

   #+ATTR_HTML: width=80%
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
   [[./static/images/mitral_h5.png]]
   #+END_CENTER

* TO DO

** Network Level

   There is also the case of visualizing large network of neurons(1000's) In
   which case, the morphology of individual cell is ignored, and each neuron
   is represented as spheres/disks which are placed according to a graphviz
   like algorithm depending on connectivity. (Also support for NetworkML)

   In this case, the data may be only spike timing data. But the tree
   structure of the previous case is still adhered and the connectivity
   between compartments is stored as text arrays inside hdf5 file itself.

** Formats

   Employ a standard format for data, HDF5 format ( NeuroHDF? )
   Support additionally Electrophys file formats ( neo? )
   Support .p file formats

   Direction of movie output - cleaner ways to do it - a possible demo?

** Examples

   More examples /use cases for documentation

** Packaging

   Easy to install packaging. Specific to each OS.

* Additional Information

** New Color Maps

   If one needs to add other colormaps to the existing, generate a list of color values (rgb)
   scaled to 1 (ie 0 to 255 = 0 to 1) and pickle this list. Ensure no name conflics when naming
   the file. Now add this pickled file in the /Moogli/openGLHeaders/colormaps folder.
   In addition use the script /Moogli/icons/makeColorMap.py to generate an icon for the colormap.

** HDF5

   #+ATTR_HTML: width=80%
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
   [[./static/images/hdfFileFormat.png]]
   #+END_CENTER

   For single/multiple neurons, the data itself is stored in arrays,
   following a strict tree structure. For example,

   filename.h5>cellName>compartmenName>propertyName
 
   corresponds to the arrayof values of that property (can be membrane potential / Ca concentration
   etc) over time. This is because, it gives an easy intuitive handle to the
   data.

* Known Issues
  
  1) Drawing of cylinders/capsules at some times, would show up as discontinous elements.[NOW FIXED]
     #+HTML: <br \>  
     Issue: Drawing of cylinders in OpenGL has an issue Ref: /Moogli/openGLHeaders/objects.py
     #+HTML: <br \>    
     Current fix: Draw as Ball&Sticks instead [THIS IS FIXED NOW]


* FAQ

  Q. Would Moogli support *some* specific file format?
  #+HTML: <br \>  
  A. The idea is to have as many supported formats as possible. Eventually that is.

  Q. I was able to see the cell initially, I zoomed out/in, now I do not see the cell!
  #+HTML: <br \>    
  A. In the /Moogli folder look for ".MoogliState.xml" file and delete it. This arises because
  of no limitation on zooming.
